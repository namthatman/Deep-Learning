## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem. Solving a data analytics challenge for a bank given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.

The goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn).

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition that is able to detect various objects in images. A CNN model is implemented to  recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else.

    1/ Accuracy:              training (85%), test (82%)
    2/ Libraries:             numpy, tensorflow, keras

    4/ Activation Function:   relu, sigmoid
    5/ Loss Function:         binary_crossentropy
    6/ Optimizer:             adam
    7/ Evaluating:            not needed
